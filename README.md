## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nauval Hilmy Firjatullah. I am currently working as a Civil Servant at the Indonesian Ministry of Immigration and Correction.

I have learned a lot about front-end web development and have mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am familiar with popular front-end libraries such as Bootstrap and ReactJS. I also have some experience with other programming languages like Python and C.

Besides programming, I have skills in video editing and design. I am familiar with tools like Sony Vegas Pro, Figma, and Canva.

In 2025, I will be 19 years old.

Regarding my educational background, I was a student at the Polytechnic State of Bandung, majoring in Informatics Engineering. However, I only attended for one semester because I was accepted as a Civil Servant at the Indonesian Ministry. Despite that, I am eager to continue learning and seeking new opportunities.

Feel free to contact me via email at Hilmyathar354@gmail.com.
